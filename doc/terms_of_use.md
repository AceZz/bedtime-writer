**Terms & Conditions**

By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trademarks, copyright, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to DreamStore Studios.

DreamStore Studios is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.

The Dreamy Tales app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, to provide our Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that the Dreamy Tales app won’t work properly or at all.

The app does use third-party services that declare their Terms and Conditions.

Link to Terms and Conditions of third-party service providers used by the app:

*   [Google Play Services](https://policies.google.com/terms)
*   [Google Analytics](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/terms/us/)
*   [Firebase Crashlytics](https://firebase.google.com/terms/crashlytics)

You should be aware that there are certain things that DreamStore Studios will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider, but DreamStore Studios cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.

If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that the terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third-party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.

Along the same lines, DreamStore Studios cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, DreamStore Studios cannot accept responsibility.

With respect to DreamStore Studios’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. DreamStore Studios accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.

At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android – the requirements for this system (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. DreamStore Studios does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you. We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.

In the case of content created and provided by the Dreamy Tales app ("App-Generated Content"), DreamStore Studios  retains all ownership rights. Users are granted a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use, access, display, and share the App-Generated Content for personal and non-commercial purposes. This means that users are allowed to share the App-Generated Content on their personal social media platforms, including those who have a large following ("influencers"). However, users are prohibited from using the App-Generated Content directly for commercial purposes, which includes selling, licensing, or otherwise profiting from the App-Generated Content without explicit written permission from DreamStore Studios. Notably, using the App-Generated Content to indirectly enhance one's commercial ventures, such as using it to increase one's social media following, does not constitute a breach of these terms. Any unauthorized commercial use of the App-Generated Content may violate copyright laws, trademark laws, and other applicable laws and regulations.

Appropriate Content Disclaimer: DreamStore Studios makes reasonable efforts to ensure that the App-Generated Content is appropriate for all users. Generative AI technologies are being used to generate text and images for the app.  However, it may produce content that may be perceived as unusual or unexpected.

Users are encouraged to use discretion and parental controls where applicable, and report any concerning content to DreamStore Studios for review. DreamStore Studios reserves the right to modify or remove any content deemed inappropriate.

Users retain all ownership rights to the content they directly own ("User Content"). However, by sharing User Content through our Services, users grant DreamStore Studios a non-exclusive, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use, modify, publicly perform or display, reproduce, and distribute their User Content in connection with operating and providing the app and its services. This license remains in effect until the User Content is removed or deleted from our Services. The user understands and agrees that DreamStore Studios may retain and continue to use, store, display, reproduce, re-post, modify, create derivative works of, and distribute any of the User Content that the user has removed or deleted to the extent it has been shared with others and they have not deleted it.
