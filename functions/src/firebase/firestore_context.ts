/**
 * This class configures and stores all the Firestore helper classes that
 * manipulate collections. You can think of it as a "context" for everything
 * Firestore: a single instance of this class is guaranteed to provide
 * consistent document and reference paths.
 *
 * You can specify a common prefix that should be put before all collection
 * paths. This is especially useful for tests (it allows doing as if each test
 * or group of tests had its own Firestore).
 *
 * As a rule of thumb, every time you find yourself hard-coding a Firestore
 * reference outside the `firebase` package, you should rather use this
 * class and its attributes (create the appropriate helper if needed).
 *
 * Use this class by instantiating it in the caller (Firebase functions, admin
 * scriptsâ€¦) and passing the appropriate helper(s) to the Firestore reader
 * and / or writer.
